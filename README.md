### What I learned
I restarted this challenge. This time I did a mini draft of the containers instead of starting the jsut starting it from scratch. My draft looked like this: 

div:container

->>div:main content-> width of main content:95%, the main content is centered

  ->>div1
      ->>image 

  ->div2
      ->>h1
      -->p


   
  ->div3
       ->>image
       -->details
       -->link


  ->>button

  -->link
  
  Doing this helped me tremendously compared to my previous attempt




### Continued development

Continue practicing CSS
